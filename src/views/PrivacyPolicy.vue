  <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">3. With third parties in order to investigate, prevent, or take action (in our sole
      discretion) regarding potentially illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
      any person, us, or the Services, or violations of our policies, the law or our Terms of Use, to verify or enforce
      compliance with the policies governing our Services.<br></span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">4. We may transfer some or all of your Information if we, or one of our business units,
      undergoes a business transition, like a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or part of our
      assets, or if a substantial portion of our or of a business unit&#39;s assets is sold or merged in this
      way.<br></span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">5. We may share the Information with Affiliates, so they can provide, improve and
      communicate with you about their own, or their marketing partners&#39; products and services.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">6. We may share the Information with unaffiliated Partners and third parties (e.g., our
      third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, other marketers,
      magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations) that wish to market
      products or services to you.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0"><br></span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Please note that the Services covered by this Privacy Policy may offer content (e.g.,
      contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications, or social network integrations) that is sponsored by or
      co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain
      information from their visitors. We have no control over these third-parties use of this information, which is
      subject to&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0"><br></span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Cookies and Other User and Ad-Targeting Technologies.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">We use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Services to you and to
      advertise to you. We also may work with Partners to help them advertise to you when you visit other websites or
      mobile applications and to help them perform user analytics. These technologies may also be used to analyze how
      our Users interact with advertising on our Services and elsewhere, and more generally, to learn more about our
      Users and what services or offers you might prefer to receive. We describe some of these technologies
      below.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">1. Cookies. To enhance your online experience, we and our partners use
      &quot;cookies&quot;, &quot;web beacons&quot; or other tracking technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your
      computer&#39;s browser to store your preferences. We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand
      Service and Internet usage and to improve or customize the products, content, offerings, services, or
      advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Services
      (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password in password-protected areas, and
      enable you to use shopping carts on our Services. We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help
      us offer you products, content, offerings, or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant
      advertising when you visit this Service, an Affiliate&#39;s Service, or when you visit other websites or
      applications. We or a third-party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your
      browser to enable you to receive customized content, offers, services, or advertisements on our Services or other
      sites. These cookies contain no information intended to identify you personally. The cookies may be associated
      with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us
      (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable
      form.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">We, our third-party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms,
      agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to manage and measure the
      performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Network and/or other networks or
      Services. This also helps us; our service providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0"><br></span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">2. Syncing Cookies and Identifiers. We may work with our Partners (for instance,
      third-party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in
      order to match our Partners&#39; uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do this, for instance, to
      enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are
      more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize
      advertising.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0"><br></span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">3. Locally Stored Objects. Services on the Network may employ locally stored objects
      (&quot;LSOs&quot;) and other client-side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they help to
      provide a better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies,
      or in order to target or help our Partners target ads, analyze ad performance, or perform user, website or market
      analytics. For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash, you can access Flash management tools from Adobe&#39;s website. In
      addition, some, but not all browsers provide the ability to remove LSOs, sometimes within cookie and privacy
      settings.</span></p>
  <p class="c1"><span class="c0"><br></span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">4. Disabling Cookies</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to
      warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies
      in your web browser, some features of the Services may be difficult to use or inoperable.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">We may work with certain third-party companies that use techniques other than HTTP
      cookies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing
      activity, including those integrated with our Services. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit
      you to block the use of these techniques, and those browser settings that block conventional cookies may have no
      effect on such techniques. To learn more about Interest-Based Advertising or to opt out of this type of
      advertising by those third parties that are members of DAA&#39;s opt-out program, please go to
      http://www.aboutads.info.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">5. Web Beacons. We may also use &quot;web beacons&quot; or clear GIFs, or similar
      technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Service or in an email, to monitor the behavior and
      collect data about the visitors viewing a Service or email. For example, web beacons may be used to count the
      users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that Service. Web beacons
      may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks,
      forwards, etc.).</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">6. Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers, publisher-facing, or app developer
      platforms that use mobile Software Development Kits (&quot;SDKs&quot;), or use an SDK with a mobile app that we
      offer, to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and
      Information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services. A mobile SDK
      is the mobile app version of a web beacon (see &quot;Web Beacons&quot; above). The SDK is a bit of computer code
      that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related
      services or analytics to be performed. We may use this technology to deliver or help our Partners deliver certain
      advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If
      you&#39;d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the
      instructions in the &quot;Your Ad Choices&quot; section below.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">By visiting the Service, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and
      agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Service through the
      technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future and that we may use such
      tracking technologies in the emails we send to you.</span></p>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Our unaffiliated Partners and third parties may themselves set and access their own
      tracking technologies when you visit our Services and they may have access to information about you and your
      online activities over time and across different websites or applications when you use the Service. Their use of
      such tracking technologies is not in our control and is subject to their own privacy policies.</span></p>

    <li class="c3 c10 li-bullet-1"><span class="c2">Google Analytics</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports
      website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared
      with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own
      advertising network.</span></p>
